 *      Classes and routines for computing and manipulating triplet relative fingerprints
 *      which is what I call a very coarse finger print of the entire molecule defined
 *      relative to a specific triplet.  The coarseness makes it more appropriate binning
 *      molecule, although of course they will not be evenly distributed.

This didn't have anywhere close to the hoped for effect. In most cases doesn't
even offset the increased fragementation.
