				  is a web server that facilitates virtual screening: it enables
				  users to search for small molecules based on their structural and
				  chemical similarity to another small molecule, with the goal of
				  identifying those that bind to a target molecule (typically a
				  protein receptor or enzyme). The search can take as input either a
				  small molecule, a set of pharmacophore features (which will be
				  subsequently described in greater detail), or both a protein and a
				  small molecule for which a putative binding pose is known. These
				  may be obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or uploaded by the
				  user directly, using one of the two options provided on the main
				  page.</span></p>

				  A structure can be obtained from the PDB by entering its four-character PDB
				  identifier in the first text box after "start from PDB". A list of
				  possible small molecules will be generated automatically in the
				  second box, from which the user may choose a ligand of interest.
				  Binding site waters may be excluded entirely, used as part of the
				  ligand as optional pharmacophore features to include in the
				  similarity search, or used as part of the receptor to identify
				  which pharmacophore features of the ligand are relevant to binding.
				  To proceed with the search, the user should next choose
				  "submit".
				  <br class="newline">
				  Alternatively the user may first choose "enter pharmit search" in

				  previously docked.
				  <em>pharmit

		<span class="font-21" id="pharmacophores">Pharmacophore Representations</span><br>
			<p class="noindent">
				<span class="font-23">
				  Pharmacophores are used to define molecular similarity and perform
				  structural alignment. Pharmacophores are abstract representations
				  of molecular features; they include both a type and a size. The
				  pharmacophore type derives from the underlying chemistry of
				  functional groups and in the context of
				  <em>pharmit
				  <sup>beta
				  </sup></em>
				  may be defined as an aromatic, hydrogen donor, hydrogen acceptor,
				  hydrophobic, negative ion, or positive ion. The set of
				  pharmacophores chosen to represent a particular ligand and their
				  geometric orientation is used to identify other molecules in a
				  database that also possess that configuration of features. The size
				  of a pharmacophore determines how closely a molecule in the
				  database must match the configuration of the query pharmacophores;
				  to be considered similar, the pharmacophore representation of a
				  molecule in the database must overlap corresponding pharmacophores
				  in the query. The likelihood of this occurring increases with
				  larger pharmacophore sizes.
				  <br class="newline">
				  <br class="newline">
				  A list of pharmacophores is provided in the "Pharmacophore" menu in
				  the sidebar. Pharmacophores can be toggled "on" or "off" to include
				  them in or remove them from the search. Pressing the "x" to the
				  right of the pharmacophore removes it from the menu entirely. By
				  pressing the arrow to the left of a given pharmacophore, the user
				  can vary the type, size, and location of a pharmacophore, as well
				  as optionally restrict the number of atoms associated with a
				  hydrophobic pharmacophore and the phi or psi angle associated with
				  pharmacophores of any type other than those that are
				  hydrophobic.</span></p>
				  <br class="newline">
				  <img src="images/pharmacophore.png" alt="Pharmacophores" width=90% align="middle">
				  <br class="newline">
				  At the bottom of the "Pharmacophore" menu, there are buttons to
				  sort the pharmacophores and to add new pharmacophores. Sorting
				  places all active pharmacophores at the top of the list and
				  organizes them by type. Since
				  <em>pharmit
				  <sup>beta
				  </sup></em>
				  loads all the pharmacophores associated with a ligand or available
				  in a query file into the workspace by default, pharmacophores added
				  using the "Add" button are initialized generically to hydrophobic
				  pharmacophores of radius 1.0 located at (0,0,0), and must be
				  set to appropriate types and locations by the
				  user.

		<span class="font-21" id="shape">Shape Constraints</span><br>
			<p class="noindent">
				<span class="font-23">
				  Users have the option of using shape as an additional constraint on
				  the similarity search. The ligand's surface or a set of
				  user-defined spheres may be used as an inclusive constraint, the
				  receptor's surface or a set of user-defined spheres may be
				  used as an exclusive constraint, or both inclusive and exclusive
				  shapes may be used. Multiple spheres may be defined for both
				  inclusive and exclusive search by choosing the "Spheres" option in
				  the dropdown menu and pressing "Add". This will display a menu
				  allowing the user to set the position and size of the sphere.
				  Pressing "Add" again will enable the user to continue adding
				  spheres. The shape constraint is applied differently depending on
				  whether it is used to search the database prior to pharmacophore
				  filtering or to filter results returned by a pharmacophore search.
				  In the former case, a shape search returns molecules in the search
				  database that contain the entire included shape and do not overlap
				  any part of the excluded shape. In the latter case, the results of
				  the pharmacophore search are filtered by shape to ensure that at
				  least one heavy atom falls within the inclusive shape and no heavy
				  atom centers fall within any exclusive shape. In either case, the
				  results of the initial search are aligned to that search for the
				  secondary filtering - thus for a given molecule a pose may exist
				  that allows it to meet the secondary filter, but it will not be
				  returned if the aligned pose resulting from the initial search does
				  not meet those constraints! Our recommendation is that users define
				  both inclusive and exclusive shape constraints using the ligand and
				  receptor surfaces and use them as secondary filtering on the
				  results of a pharmacophore search. The order of application of
				  pharmacophore and shape constraints can be swapped using the second
				  button from the top of the left sidebar, which switches between
				  "Pharmacophore Search

				  returning the first <em>n</em> results found without prioritizing any other
				  aspects of those results. The other two constraints are applied
				  after the results are sorted, giving priority to those of higher
				  rank. There are seven options given for hit screening. These
				  include constraints on molecular weight, the number of rotatable
				  bonds, LogP (a measure of lipophilicity), polar surface area
				  (indicative of ability to permeate cell membranes), the number of
				  aromatic groups, the number of hydrogen bond acceptors, and the
				  number of hydrogen bond donors. These are all applied after the

				  There are two buttons available at the bottom of the right sidebar.
				  The "Save" button allows the results to be saved in their current
				  state; this generates a single file in sdf format that contains all
				  the structures that were returned by the query. The structures are
				  sorted in the output in the same order that they are sorted in the
				  sidebar. Pressing the "Minimize" button before saving allows the
				  user to assess the favorability of the interaction between the
				  protein and the ligands returned by the search. This feature energy
				  minimizes the results using smina, a fork of AutoDock Vina, using
				  the default Vina scoring function. Using this scoring function, a
				  more negative score indicates that the corresponding interaction is
				  more favorable according to the scoring function's model of
				  protein-ligand interaction; thus large positive scores indicate
				  unfavorable interactions, and large negative scores indicate more
				  favorable interactions. If the user chooses to minimize the
				  results, they may be sorted by score or RMSD of the minimized pose
				  from the starting pose (which was aligned to the query) by pressing
				  the name of the sorting method. Additional filters may also be
				  applied by setting values for maximum score, maximum minimized
				  RMSD, and requesting that only one pose be retained for each
				  conformer. Once the filters have been set as desired, the user
				  should press "Apply" to enforce them. Pressing "Save" after
				  minimizing the results generates a single sdf file containing the
				  minimized structures that includes their minimized scores; it is
				  often useful to rank the structures in order of increasing score so
				  that the best results can be
