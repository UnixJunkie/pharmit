BUILDING

Currently, the easiest way to build pharmer is to checkout the source code
using Eclipse and build it with the automatically generated make files.
The contribution of a standard autoconf/make build system would be greatly
appreciated.

There are several dependencies on third party libraries:
Boost (currently building against version 1.45)
http://www.boost.org/

JsonCpp
http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/

FastCGI
http://www.fastcgi.com

cgicc
http://www.gnu.org/software/cgicc/

tcmalloc (google performance tools)
http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/

OpenBabel

USING

The --help option will provide the following:

USAGE: pharmer [options] --cmd command [pharma, dbcreate, dbsearch, server]

OPTIONS:
  -bloom-large=<uint>  - Number of bits for coarse discretization fingerprint.
  -bloom-small=<uint>  - Number of bits for fine discretization fingerprint.
  -cmd=<string>        - command [pharma, dbcreate, dbsearch, server]
  -dbdir=<string>      - database directory(s)
  -extra-info          - Output additional molecular properties.  Slower.
  -file-partition      - Partion database slices based on files
  -help                - Display available options (--help-hidden for more)
  -in=<string>         - input file(s)
  -logdir=<string>     - log directory for server
  -max-hits=<n>        - return at most n results
  -max-orient=<n>      - return at most n orientations of each conformation
  -max-rmsd=<number>   - maximum allowed RMSD; default max allowed by query
  -max-weight=<uint>   - maximum allowed molecular weight
  -nthreads=<n>        - utilize n threads; default 1
  -out=<string>        - output file
  -pharmaspec=<string> - pharmacophore specification
  -port=<uint>         - port for server to listen on
  -print               - print results
  -q                   - quiet; suppress informational messages
  -reduceconfs=<n>     - return at most n conformations for each molecule
  -separate-weight     - Segregate database based on molecular weight
  -show-query          - print query points
  -sort-rmsd           - Sort results by RMSD.
  -unweighted-rmsd     - Compute minimal RMSD without radius weights

To IDENTIFY the pharmacophore features of a molecule ex.pdb:
 pharmer pharma -in ex.pdb
 pharmer pharma -in ex.pdb -out out.sdf
 pharmer pharma -in ex.pdb -out out.json
For interactive, graphical editting of pharmacophore features, try
http://zincpharmer.csb.pitt.edu
The saved session file is a json file that can be used as input for Pharmer.

To CREATE a database DB from library.sdf:
 pharmer dbcreate -dbdir DB -in library.sdf
If you have multiple disk drives, you can improve performance by striping the
database across the drives:
 pharmer dbcreate -dbdir /drive1/DB -dbdir /drive2/DB -in library.sdf
If you pre-split the input file things will go faster:
 pharmer dbcreate -dbdir /drive1/DB -dbdir /drive2/DB -file-partition -in library1.sdf -in library2.sdf

To SEARCH a database:
 pharmer dbsearch -dbdir DB -in query.json
 pharmer dbsearch -dbdir DB -in query.sdf
 pharmer dbsearch -dbdir DB -in query.ph4

BUGS (Not Really)

When working with large datasets spread across multiple hard drives,
you will likely run into a number of limits that will result in 
segmentation faults (type 6 or 11).  These changes need to be in place
before building the database, or it will silently create incomplete 
databases that crash when you search them.

Make sure nofile is set high enough (1000000) in /etc/security/limits.conf

Make sure vm.max_map_count is set high enough - add the following to /etc/sysctl.conf
vm.max_map_count=1000000

Make sure you build against libcurl4-openssl-dev, not gnutls, or you
will get fortify_fail errors.


BUGS (Really)

Send any bug reports to dkoes@pitt.edu with a complete test case.
